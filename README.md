Virtual Study Room is a responsive, browser-based productivity tool built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates a focused study environment inspired by the Pomodoro technique, helping students and professionals manage their time and tasks efficiently.

The application includes a 25/5/15 minute timer cycle (focus/short/long break), a dynamic task manager, session statistics, and ambient sound options like rain and café for enhanced concentration. Users can set their current subject, daily goals, and take notes — all in one place.
